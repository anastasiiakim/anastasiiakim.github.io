excerpt: 'This work addresses the critical issue of orphaned wells—inactive oil and gas wells that are often unreported and contribute significantly to climate change, groundwater contamination, and toxic emissions. With potentially millions of these wells in the U.S. alone, locating them is essential for effective environmental remediation. Our paper presents a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution 120,948 aerial images of documented orphan wells, accompanied by segmentation masks and metadata.'

>Abstract: <br/> Orphaned wells are wells for which the operator is unknown or insolvent. The location of hundreds of thousands of these wells remain unknown in the United States alone. Cost-effective techniques are essential to locate orphaned wells to address environmental problems. In this paper, we present a dataset consisting of 120,948 aerial images of recently documented orphan wells. Each of these 512 × 512 images is paired with segmentation masks that indicate the presence or absence of such well. These images, sourced from the National Agriculture Imagery Program, cover the continental United States with spatial resolutions ranging from 30 centimeters to 1 meter. Additionally, we included negative examples by selecting locations uniformly across the United States. Accompanying metadata includes the IDs and spatial resolution of the original images, which are available for free through the United States Geological Survey, and the pixel coordinates of documented orphaned wells identified in these images. This dataset is intended to support the development of deep-learning models that can help locating undocumented orphan wells from such imagery, thereby blunting the environmental damage they do.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the University of New Mexico advised by James Degnan. My research is in the field of Statistical Phylogenetics that, in combination with math, biology, and computer science, forms a powerful tool to study evolutionary processes in a reconstruction of species relationships from genetic data.

I work with ranked gene trees that give the potential to improve species tree inference. I am interested in applying research skills, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques to answer challenging problems.

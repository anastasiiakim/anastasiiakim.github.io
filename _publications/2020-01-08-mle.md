>Abstract: <br/> PRANC computes the Probabilities of RANked gene tree topologies under the multispecies Coalescent. A ranked gene tree is a gene tree accounting for the temporal ordering of internal nodes. PRANC can also estimate the maximum likelihood species tree from the sample of ranked or unranked gene tree topologies. It estimated maximum likelihood tree with estimated branch lengths.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Los Alamos National Lab. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of New Mexico advised by James Degnan. My dissertation research is in the field of Statistical Phylogenetics that, in combination with math, biology, and computer science, forms a powerful tool to study evolutionary processes in a reconstruction of species relationships from genetic data.

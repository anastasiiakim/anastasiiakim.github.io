excerpt: 'In this paper, we identified corn soil microbiome communities associated with different experimental conditions, such as watering treatment and soil source type, at each taxonomic level using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Unlike traditional methods used for microbial analysis which target individual taxa, LDA provides an effective way to quickly find significant correlations of groups of multiple taxa with plant traits responsible for its performance under water stress. LDA identified microbiome compositions that may act synergistically toward some ecological function in plant-microbiome interaction.'

>Abstract: <br/> Interactions between stressed organisms and their microbiome environments may provide new routes for understanding and controlling biological systems. However, microbiomes are a form of high-dimensional data, with thousands of taxa present in any given sample, which makes untangling the interaction between an organism and its microbial environment a challenge. Here we apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a technique for language modeling, which decomposes the microbial communities into a set of topics (non-mutually-exclusive sub-communities) that compactly represent the distribution of full communities. LDA provides a lens into the microbiome at broad and fine-grained taxonomic levels, which we show on two datasets. In the first dataset, from the literature, we show how LDA topics succinctly recapitulate many results from a previous study on diseased coral species. We then apply LDA to a new dataset of maize soil microbiomes under drought, and find a large number of significant associations between the microbiome topics and plant traits as well as associations between the microbiome and the experimental factors, e.g. watering level. This yields new information on the plant-microbial interactions in maize and shows that LDA technique is useful for studying the coupling between microbiomes and stressed organisms.

I am a staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of New Mexico advised by James Degnan. My dissertation research is in the field of Statistical Phylogenetics that, in combination with combinatorics, probability, computational biology, and computer science, forms a powerful tool to study evolutionary processes in a reconstruction of species relationships from genetic data.

My research interests include statistical inference, machine learning, computer vision, data science, high performance computing, computational biology, and phylogenetic inference.

excerpt: 'In this paper, we identified corn soil microbiome communities associated with different experimental conditions, such as watering treatment and soil source type, at each taxonomic level using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Unlike traditional methods used for microbial analysis which target individual taxa, LDA provides an effective way to quickly find significant correlations of groups of multiple taxa with plant traits responsible for its performance under water stress. LDA identified microbiome compositions that may act synergistically toward some ecological function in plant-microbiome interaction.'
